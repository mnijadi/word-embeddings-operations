# Operations On GloVe Word Embeddings

## Description

Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. They are a distributed representation for text that is perhaps one of the key breakthroughs for the impressive performance of deep learning methods on challenging natural language processing problems.  
In this notebook, we will explore the GloVe word embeddings and perform some operations on them for solving word analogy problems.
